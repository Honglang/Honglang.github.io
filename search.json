Students will learn how to read data, manipulate it using various SAS statements and options, perform descriptive analyses using procedures such as proc means, proc univariate, and proc freq. They will also learn how to create charts using proc chart and proc gplot. Additionally, the course covers conditional statements, loops, arrays, macros, and advanced procedures such as proc iml for statistical modeling. Students will explore topics including categorical analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, and regression using SAS.\nIn the R Statistical Software component, students will delve into various aspects, including the R environment and syntax, managing workspaces and directories, input/output operations, working with vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames, and lists. Additionally, they will explore scalar and vector arithmetic calculations, expressions, and functions. The course also covers R packages, programming techniques, conditional statements, loops, and data visualization using R’s graphical capabilities. Furthermore, students will gain exposure to topics such as random sampling, probability distributions, t-tests, ANOVA, and regression within the R environment.\nThe course also introduces students to computational methods and statistical modeling. They will gain knowledge in simulation studies, permutation tests, bootstrapping, logistic regression, high-dimensional linear regression with LASSO and Ridge penalties, and nonparametric smoothing. If time permits, machine learning and deep learning methods may also be discussed.\nUpon completing this course, students will be equipped with the ability to utilize SAS and R to perform a range of statistical tasks. They will be proficient in reading and writing data, conducting descriptive analyses, visualizing data distributions, and performing statistical analyses such as chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and regression. Furthermore, students will be able to optimize univariate and multivariate functions using both user-defined and built-in functions. They will also gain expertise in using numerical methods to find maximum likelihood estimations, simulating random variables, and implementing modern statistical methodologies such as bootstrapping and high-dimensional LASSO and Ridge regression.\n\nFinal Project Samples\n\nFall 2024: Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis in the EASE Framework: Evaluating Semi-Supervised Imputation Methods"

    "text": "Useful tips for building an academic Quarto site\n\nUsing “Includes” for reusable content\nTo streamline updates across your site, use Quarto’s includes feature for reusable elements like syllabus statements, social sharing options, academic badges, and other reuseable materials. By doing this, you only need to update a single source file, and then rerender the site to reflect changes across all pages.\n{{include _statement.qmd}}\nPrefixing include file names with an underscore (“_“) ensures they won’t be rendered directly by Quarto.\nHere is an example course description, and reuse it in mainpage and syllabus.\n\n\nAcademic badges\nDisplay academic badges like the Dimension Citation badge and Altmetric badge.\n\nHere’s an example for embedding them:\n&lt;span class=\"__dimensions_badge_embed__\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-style=\"large_rectangle\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-badge-popover=\"right\" data-badge-type=\"1\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-hide-no-mentions=\"true\" class=\"altmetric-embed\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nReplace the doi with your own.\nMake sure to include below scripts in the same page to enable the badges:\n&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script async src=\"https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nYou can also showcase your highly cited and hot papers using custom badges.\n \n![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/highly-cited-paper-badge.png \"ESI Highly Cited Paper\"){width=20 fig-alt=\"Highly cited paper\"} ![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/hot-paper-badge.png \"ESI Hot Paper\"){width=20 fig-alt=\"Hot paper\"}\nHere is an example, and the source code.\n\n\nSocial sharing\nFor easy setup of social sharing buttons, AddToAny is a simple solution.\nUsing includes files here will make it easier to manage updates, as any changes to social buttons need only be made once.\nHere is an example.\n\n\nThe art of listing\nListings are a powerful tool in Quarto, offering flexibility for creating visually appealing and organized pages. By adjusting listing options, you can control how content is presented.\nType: default, grid, table\nOptions: grid-columns, image-height, grid-item-align\nDisplay: fields and field-display-names\nBy mastering these options, you can easily create pages that fit your content needs while maintaining a clean, user-friendly design.\nHere is an example, and source code; another example, and source code.\n\n\nListing external items\nIf you need to list external resources with key metadata, you can use this format to create clear, linked listings.\n    - path: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6\n      image: /files/images/journal/nature.avif\n      title: \"Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains\"\n      subtitle: \"*Nature*\"\n      description: \"Globalized supply chain has saved solar installers in the U.S., Germany, and China $67B 2008-2020, and solar prices will be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move to produce domestically.\"\n      date: \"2022-10-26\"\nIf you have many items to list, it’s efficient to store them in a YAML(.yml) file. You can then reference this YAML file in Quarto.\nHere is an example, and source code."

Statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits.\n1. No later than one year after the effective date of this article, the department shall, pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated after at least one public hearing, establish a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit as a percentage of 1990 emissions, as estimated pursuant to section 75-0105 of this article, as follows:\na. 2030: 60% of 1990 emissions.\nb. 2050: 15% of 1990 emissions.\n2. Greenhouse gas emission limits shall be measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents and identified for each individual type of green-house gas.\n\n\n\nPower sector and renewable goals\n\n2030: Generate 70% of electricity from renewable energy sources\n\n2040: Achieve 100% zero-emission electricity\n\n\n§ 66-p. Establishment of a renewable energy program.\n1. As used in this section:\n(a) “jurisdictional load serving entity” means any entity subject to the jurisdiction of the commission that secures energy to serve the electrical energy requirements of end-use customers in New York state;\n(b) “renewable energy systems” means systems that generate electricity or thermal energy through use of the following technologies: solar thermal, photovoltaics, on land and offshore wind, hydroelectric, geothermal electric, geothermal ground source heat, tidal energy, wave energy, ocean thermal, and fuel cells which do not utilize a fossil fuel resource in the process of generating electricity.\n2. No later than June thirtieth, two thousand twenty-one, the commission shall establish a program to require that: (a) a minimum of seventy percent of the state wide electric generation secured by jurisdictional load serving entities to meet the electrical energy requirements of all end-use customers in New York state in two thousand thirty shall be generated by renewable energy systems; and (b) that by the year two thousand forty (collectively, the “targets”) the statewide electrical demand system will be zero emissions.\n\n\nTechnological specific goals:\n\n2025: Install 6 GW solar PV\n\n2030: Install 3 GW energy storage\n\n2035: Install 9 GW of offshore wind\n\n\n\n\nNo later than July first, two thousand twenty-four, the commission shall establish programs to require the procurement by the state’s load serving entities of at least nine gigawatts of offshore wind electricity generation by two thousand thirty-five and six gigawatts of photovoltaic solar generation by two thousand twenty-five, and to support three giga-watts of statewide energy storage capacity by two thousand thirty.\n\n\n\n\nWhat also in the bill?\n\nEstablish the New York state climate action council (“council”)\nAt least 35% of the benefits directed to disadvantaged communities with a goal to achieve 40%\n\n\n75-0117. Investment of funds.\nState agencies, authorities and entities, in consultation with the environmental justice working group and the climate action council, shall, to the extent practicable, invest or direct available and relevant programmatic resources in a manner designed to achieve a goal for disadvantaged communities to receive forty percent of overall benefits of spending on clean energy and energy efficiency programs, projects or investments in the areas of housing, workforce development, pollution reduction, low income energy assistance, energy, transportation and economic development, provided however, that disadvantaged communities shall receive no less than thirty-five percent of the overall benefits of spending on clean energy and energy efficiency programs, projects or investments and provided further that this section shall not alter funds already contracted or committed as of the effective date of this section.\n\nSource Document: Senate Bill S6599"
