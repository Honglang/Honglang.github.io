I had the pleasure to teach the STAT 512 (Linear Regression) and STAT 521 (Statistical Computing) in Fall 2024. The goal of STAT 512 is to enable the students to have a good theoretical and practical understanding about linear models. The goal of STAT 521 is to enable the students to know two programing languages SAS and R as well as some wonderful statistical learning methodologies. Below are some nice final projects from these two courses.
