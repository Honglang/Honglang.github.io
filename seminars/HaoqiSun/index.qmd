**Title: Sleep as a Window into Health using Artificial Intelligence**

**Abstract**: We will introduce AI applications in healthcare, with sleep medicine as an example with big data readily available. We will discuss the opportunities and difficulties of AI in sleep medicine. I hope that this presentation can bring potential collaborations using novel AI methods to address important questions in sleep disorders, brain health such as neurodegenerative diseases, and health in general.
