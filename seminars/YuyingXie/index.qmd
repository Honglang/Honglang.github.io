**Title: Single Cells Are Biological Tokens: Towards Cell Language Models**

**Abstract**: The current state-of-the-art single-cell pre-trained models are greatly inspired by the success of large language models. They trained transformers by treating genes as tokens and cells as sentences. However, three fundamental differences between single-cell data and natural language data are overlooked: (1) scRNA-seq data are presented as bag-of-genes instead of sequences of RNAs; (2) Cell-cell relations are more intricate and important than inter-sentence relations; and (3) The quantity of single-cell data is considerably inferior to text data, and they are very noisy. In light of these characteristics, we propose a new pre-trained model, CellPLM, which takes cells as tokens and tissues as sentences. In addition, we leverage spatially resolved transcriptomic data in pre-training to facilitate learning cell-cell relationships and introduce a Gaussian mixture prior distribution as an additional inductive bias to overcome data limitations.  This is the first single-cell pre-trained transformer that encodes cell-cell relations, and it consistently outperforms existing pre-trained and non-pre-trained models in diverse downstream tasks.

**Bio**: Dr. [Yuying Xie](https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/directory/Profiles/Person/101084) is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Computational Mathematics, Science & Engineering and Statistics & Probability at Michigan State University. He holds dual Ph.D. degrees in Statistics and Genetics. Dr. Xie’s research develops statistical machine learning and deep learning methods for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, with applications to cancer, colitis, and infectious diseases. His group won the first place in NeurIPS 2021 Single-cell Competition and silver medal (rank 24/1266) in NeurIPS 2022 Single-Cell competition.
